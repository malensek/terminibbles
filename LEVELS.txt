Creating New Levels
===================

A terminibbles level file is composed of plain text instructions on where to
place wall (obstacle) tiles on the game board.  The game board is 39 columns by
22 lines.

Walls are represented by 'X' characters; all other characters are assumed to be
blank space.  Characters beyond 39 columns or 22 lines are ignored.  Remember
that enclosed areas must be filled in with wall tiles; otherwise food could
become unreachable.

The "blank" level provides a blank level file with some character-based guides
to delineate the column/line limits.
